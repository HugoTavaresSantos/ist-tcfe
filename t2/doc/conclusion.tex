\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\pargraph In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing an RC circuit has been
achieved with success. 

The theoretical estimates were compared with the simulation results, yielding very similar results. The plots obtainted from performing the nodal method in
 GNU Octave and the simulation in NGSpice are mostly identical, with errors being of such low order of magnitude that they become negligible,
 and are most likely attributable to rounding errors. This outcome was expected, since the circuit is composed of linear components, and hence NGSpice likely 
used the same methods as Octave did in the theoretical part. Because the results are coherent and within expectation, we consider this task to be successful.
