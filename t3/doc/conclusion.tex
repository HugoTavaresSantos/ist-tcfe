\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of creating and analysing an AC/DC converter circuit has been achieved with success. 
We have performed theoreticall and simulation analysis, using the Octave for the former and Ngspice for the latter.

We found some discrepancies between both sets of results, which can be atributed to the non-linear behaviour of the diodes. Nonetheless, this discrepancies can also be expected in real life,
given that ideal diodes do not exist. Also, those small variations did not compromise the objective of the lab.

We also believe that, given the satisfactory results obtained by us, the model used could be applied in a real life AC/DC rectifier.

Finally, this assignment allowed us to gain some knowledge on AC and DC and how to convert from the first to the second.
