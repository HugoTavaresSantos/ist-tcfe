\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

\paragraph{} Before anything we performed an operating point analysis to check if the transistor was operating in the forward operating region.

[TABELA]

\paragraph{} The results we obtained were the following. We can see that VCE > VBEON (0.7 V) which is the desirable result.

\subsection{Gain Stage}

\paragraph{} For the gain stage, the incremental stage provided the following results:

[TABELA]

\paragraph{} From where we reach the conclusion that an output stage in necessary. [...].

\subsection{Output Stage}

\paragraph{} As we can see, the output independance of this stage is much lower than the input.

\paragraph{} The output stage is also desirably low, specially when compared with the 8 Ohm of the speakers.
