\section{Simulation Analysis}

[FALTAM TABELAS AQUI]

\paragraph{} Given the input signal of the circuit is sinusoidal the voltage and current values vary with time, and it is relevant to know how the two parameters evovlve with time.

\paragraph{} As such, we ran a transient analysis for the circuit, lasting 10 periods.

\paragraph{} In the simulation there was a period of about 4 seconds necessary for the output voltage to stabilize. As such, only this period is considered.
