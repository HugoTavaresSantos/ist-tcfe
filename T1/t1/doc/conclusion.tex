\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of studying the presented circuit has been achieved.Our static analysed was performed both theorically, using the software octave math tool, and by circuit simulation, using the Ngspice tool.If this was a presential lab class, there would be all sort of experimental errors like internal resistances of the sources, temperature etc.However using a computer simulation, as expected, the theoretical results obtained using the Mesh and Node methods and the the simulation results mathced precisely.The reason for the perfect match is the fact that this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components - this implies, as pointed out in the theory classes, that the theoretical and simulation moddels cannot differ.For more complex compoents, the theoretical and simulation models could differ but this is not the case in this work as the circuit is fairly simple.
This lab assignment has been useful to put in practice our knowledge about circuits and taugh us how to use sophisticated softwares that, as engineers, will be very helpfull such as Git, Makefile, Octave and Ngspice.
