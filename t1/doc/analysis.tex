\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, the circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fic:circuit} is analysed using the Mesh and Node Methods, after which both results are compared.
Those methods are based upon the Kirchoff Laws, and the behaviour of the elements of the circuit, which are detailed bellow.

Kirchoff Laws

The analysis of this circuit is based on the Kirchoff's Circuit Laws, more specifically, the Kirchoff's Current and Voltage laws (KCL and KVL). The first law states that
 for a given node, the sum of the electrical currents flowing out of the node is equal to the sum of currents flowing into that node. 
It can be translated into the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  sum_{k = 1}^n I_k = 0.
  \label{eq:kcl}
\end{equation}

The second law states that the sum of all the voltages in mesh must be zero, and can be translated into the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  sum_{k = 1}^n V_k = 0.
  \label{eq:kvl}
\end{equation}

Resistor

A resistor is an electrical component that poses resistance (as the name implies) to current flow, reducing it. The functioning of a resistor can be described
 by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  frac{.
  \label{eq:kvl}
\end{equation}













In this section, the circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rc} is analysed
theoretically, in terms of its time and frequency responses.

\section{Time response}

The circuit consists of a single V-R-C loop where a current $i(t)$ circulates. The
voltage source $v_I(t)$ drives its input, and the output voltage $v_O(t)$ is taken from
the capacitor terminals. Applying the Kirchhoff Voltage Law (KVL), a single
equation for the single loop in the circuit can be written as

\begin{equation}
  Ri(t) + v_O(t) = v_I(t).
  \label{eq:kvl}
\end{equation}

Because $v_O$ is the voltage between capacitor C's plates, it is related to the
current $i$ by
\begin{equation}
  i(t) = C\frac{dv_O}{dt}.
\end{equation}

Hence, Equation~(\ref{eq:kvl}) can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  RC\frac{dv_O}{dt} + v_O(t) = v_I.
  \label{eq:kvl2}
\end{equation}

Equation~(\ref{eq:kvl2}) is a linear differencial equation whose solution is a
superposition of a natural solution $v_{On}$ and a forced solution $v_{Of}$:

\begin{equation}
  v_O(t) = v_{On}(t) + v_{Of}(t).
  \label{eq:vo_sol}
\end{equation}

As learned in the theory classes the natural solution is of the form
\begin{equation}
  v_{On}(t) = Ae^{-\frac{t}{RC}},
  \label{eq:vo_nat}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is an integration constant.

The forced solution is of the form given in Equation~(\ref{eq:vo_for}) and is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:forced}.

\begin{equation}
  V_{Of}(t) = |\bar{V}_{Of}| cos(\omega t + \angle \bar{V}_{Of}),
  \label{eq:vo_for}
\end{equation}
